TouchSim simulates spiking responses from thousands of tactile afferents terminating on the palmar surface of the hand to arbitrary indentation of the skin (see [Saal, Delhaye et al., PNAS, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1704856114)).

Find the original [Matlab version](https://github.com/BensmaiaLab/touchSim) in the Bensmaia Lab Github.

We also developed a [Python port](https://github.com/hsaal/touchsim) that produces nearly identical output (up to small numerical errors) and can be faster for large population sizes. Check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/hsaal/touchsim) and feel free to raise issues or pull requests to add improvements. You can also play with the model online in a Jupyter Notebook through myBinder by clicking on the launch icon below (note: be patient, it can take several minutes for the notebook to load).
