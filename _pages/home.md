# Welcome to the Active Touch Lab!

The Active Touch Laboratory uses methods in animal behaviour, neuroethology, human psychophysics, computational modelling and robotics to investigate tactile sensing in animals, people and intelligent machines.

We are based at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology). We are also affiliated with Sheffield Robotics, [INSIGNEO Institute for *in silico* Medicine](https://insigneo.org/), and the [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/neuroscience-institute).
