  description: I studied <a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Osnabr√ºck, Germany. After an internship at the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8017">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a>, I obtained an MSc and PhD in Neuroinformatics at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">University of Edinburgh</a>. I was then a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="https://bensmaialab.github.io/">Sliman Bensmaia's lab</a> at the University of Chicago, before joining the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology">University of Sheffield</a> to set up my own lab. For most of my career I have worked on the sense of touch, using methods from computational neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning.

  description: I am a research associate in computational neuroscience with experience in complex networks, comparative neuroanatomy and cell culturing. In the Active Touch Lab I am helping people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! In addition to that, I am a member of INSIGNEO and a data scientist for the AMRC at the University of Sheffield. My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience and information processing in the somatosensory cortex.

  description: I am a research associate investigating mechanisms that influence topography and magnification in the somatosensory cortex of both humans and non-human primates. I was previously a PhD student in the lab, focusing on modelling somatosensory cortex using dimensionality reduction techniques and self-organising models.

  description: I am a research fellow supervised by Hannes Saal. I am part of the <a href="https://neutouch.eu/">NeuTouch</a> project, included in the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. My research focuses on spiking models of realistic human tactile interactions. I am interested in the development of a computational method that translates sensor input into spiking output to deliver realistic and real-time tactile feedback for neuroprosthetics and robotics.

  description: I am a PhD student, part of the MRC <a href="https://www.dimen.org.uk">DiMeN</a> DTP. My research involves the investigation of tactile processing in the foot along with investigating different gait variables. I have previously worked on computational modelling of homeostatic plasticity in the somatosensory cortex in the context of touch.
