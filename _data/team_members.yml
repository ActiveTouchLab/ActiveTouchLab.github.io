  description: I studied <a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Osnabr√ºck, Germany. After an internship at the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8017">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a>, I obtained an MSc and PhD in Neuroinformatics at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">University of Edinburgh</a>. I was then a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="https://bensmaialab.github.io/">Sliman Bensmaia's lab</a> at the University of Chicago, before joining the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology">University of Sheffield</a> to set up my own lab. For most of my career I have worked on the sense of touch, using methods from computational neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning.

  description: I'm a research associate with experience in comparative neuroanatomy, cell culturing, multichannel electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. Utilising my programming and data analysis/data modelling skills I'm working on the modelling of the responses of afferent fibres of the foot sole. In addition, I'm also a guest lecturer for the computational neuroscience module.

  description: I am a PhD student supervised by Hannes Saal & Stuart Wilson. My research focuses on modelling somatosensory cortex using dimensionality reduction techniques and self-organising models. I am interested in the mechanisms which determine the topography and magnification of the hand seen in the primary somatosensory cortex of both humans and non-human primates.

  description: I am a PhD student supervised by Hannes Saal. I am part of the <a href="https://neutouch.eu/">NeuTouch</a> project, included in the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. My research focuses on the spiking models of realistic human tactile interactions. I am interested in the development of a computational method that translates sensor input into spiking output to deliver realistic and real-time tactile feedback for neuroprosthetics and robotics.

  description: I am a PhD student, part of the MRC <a href="https://www.dimen.org.uk">DiMeN</a> DTP. My research involves the investigation of tactile processing in the foot along with investigating different gait variables. I have previously worked on computational modelling of homeostatic plasticity in the somatosensory cortex in the context of touch.

My research interests focus on constructing computational models inspired by neural architectures or brain activities. My current project uses computer vision to reconstruct skin movements during object interaction.
