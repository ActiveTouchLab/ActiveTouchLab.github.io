  description: I studied <a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Osnabr√ºck, Germany. After an internship at the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8017">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a>, I obtained an MSc and PhD in Neuroinformatics at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">University of Edinburgh</a>. I was then a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="https://bensmaialab.github.io/">Sliman Bensmaia's lab</a> at the University of Chicago, before joining the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology">University of Sheffield</a> to set up my own lab. For most of my career I have worked on the sense of touch, using methods from computational neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning.

  description: I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Nanjing University, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and my Ph.D. from the University of Glasgow, UK, in 2020. I am currently a Marie Curie Global Postdoctoral Fellow working on the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101111036">Neuro-encoded Electronic Skin (NEUCODES)</a> project. I also serve as Researcher Co-I on the EPSRC-funded project Green Optimized Printed Integrated Circuits (GEOPIC). My research interests include electronic skin, robotic tactile sensing, printed and flexible electronics, and emerging neuromorphic devices. During my secondment at the Active Touch Lab, I will focus on extending the TouchSim model for electronic skin.
