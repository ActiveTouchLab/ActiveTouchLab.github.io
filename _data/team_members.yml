  description: I'm a research associate with experience in comparative neuroanatomy, cell culturing, multichannel electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. Utilising my programming and data analysis/data modelling skills I'm working on the modelling of the responses of afferent fibres of the foot sole. In addition, I'm also a guest lecturer for the computational neuroscience module.

  description: I am a PhD student supervised by Hannes Saal & Stuart Wilson. My research focuses on modelling somatosensory cortex using dimensionality reduction techniques and self-organising models. I am interested in the mechanisms which determine the topography and magnification of the hand seen in the primary somatosensory cortex of both humans and non-human primates.

  description: I am a PhD student supervised by Hannes Saal. I am part of the NeuTouch project, included in the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. My research focuses on the spiking models of realistic human tactile interactions. I am interested in the development of a computational method that translates sensor input into spiking output to deliver realistic and real-time tactile feedback for neuroprosthetics and robotics.

  description: I am currently a student on the Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Masters. My research focuses on proprioception and relates to the representation of the hand in the somatotosensory cortex. I investigate how the representation in the brain may change depending on the use of the hand.
